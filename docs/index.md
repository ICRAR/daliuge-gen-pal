# Home and Installation

This is the palette generator of the [DALiuGE](https://daliuge.readthedocs.io) system.

It processes a file or a directory of source files and
produces a DALiuGE compatible palette file containing the
information required to use the identified functions and classes and methods to construct logical graphs in [EAGLE](https://eagle-dlg.readthedocs.io).
